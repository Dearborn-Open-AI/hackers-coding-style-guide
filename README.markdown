2011 Hacker's Coding Style Guide
================================

Can't stand the code your mates produce? Or maybe looking to improve your own style? Here are the conventions I use and recommend. Enjoy them as is, or fork on GitHub and adjust to your taste.

See [the online version of this guide on tarantsov.com](http://tarantsov.com/hackers-coding-style-guide/), or compile your own using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) or [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).
