Can't stand the code your mates produce? Or maybe looking to improve your own style? Here are the conventions I use and recommend. Enjoy them as is, or [fork on GitHub and adjust to your taste](https://github.com/andreyvit/hackers-coding-style).


## Table of Contents

[Good Code-P?](good-code.html) — Which code is good? The one that targets a human being, not a computer. One that is easy to understand, idiomatic and blends in to the platform.

[Whitespace & Indentation](whitespace.html) — Avoid tabs ([why?](why-tabs-should-be-avoided.html)), use idiomatic indentation or 4 spaces otherwise.


## Why is this guide so short?

Because I'm still working on it.
